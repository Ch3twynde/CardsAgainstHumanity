# Cards Against Humanity
##A version of Cards Against Humanity using their free card set.
######NOTE: I do not own any trademarks, copyrights or anything else pertaining to the actual game, "Cards Against Humanity".
I built this in a few days worth of work in my "spare time" (i.e. I really have none) when my friends and I couldn't find the deck anywhere.

The game logic is all in place, and I was testing with visual placeholders (tableviews).
My latest task was to be able to link anyone in BLE range up to the game (no internet connection, eg), with online-remote,
server-connected games to come later.

Visually the goal was to have all the above items in place and move everything into Facebook's open source Paper-style framework,
as (you might have guessed) perfect for card-style games.

This *was* my goal, until the real Cards Against Humanity company released their full version of the game for mobile, almost exactly
(as far as I can tell) to the spec I had designed. 

*sigh*

Well this code is open source if anyone wants to fork or contribute to it.
